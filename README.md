I have abandoned mpc-be due to lack of development and switched to mpc-hc.

# mpchc-video-editor
Fast way to cut and merge video clips using mpc-hc player found here: https://github.com/clsid2/mpc-hc

## Configuration

Middle mouse button (scroll wheel click) is the default hotkey. You can change this in the hotkey menu.
