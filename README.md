I have abandoned mpc-be due to lack of development and switched to mpc-hc.

# mpchc-video-editor
Fast way to cut and merge video clips using mpc-hc player found here: https://github.com/clsid2/mpc-hc

## Configuration
This must be set to "display full path" or else program will not work.

Middle mouse button (scroll wheel click) is the default hotkey. You can change this in the hotkey menu.
